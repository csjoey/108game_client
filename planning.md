# Ideas for game

### Leaps and Bounds:

1. Character evolution
  * Items pickups
  * character stats/skills?

2. Obstacles to test heros ability to leap into action
  * a jump button...
  * some sort of basic combat

3. Deduct points for anything going out of bounds
  * Time limit counts?
  * literal holes on edge of map?

4. duck, dip, dive, and dodge an enemy that's changing or moving rapidly
  * dodge moving obstacles, enemies, traps (ie arrows, ball and chain, pressure plates)

5. Take place in 2020, the next leap year
  * Theme based on modern era? incorporate election memes
