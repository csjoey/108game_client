## Enter the Dungon

    Thrive in a world you've inspired.

    Yes it's spelled that way on purpose.
    Enter the dungon is a proceedurally genrated dungeon crawler which you provide the
    inital input for. To play the game, use WASD to move around and enter to attack. Watch out
    for enemies who will attack you if you're next to them, but hit them once and theyll drop a heart.
    in order to progress to the next room, you must collect all the coins, but watch out! if you run 
    out of time displayed in the top right corner, or health displayed in the top left, the game ends.
    
    Enemies drop hearts and 2 time when killed.
    
    Once you've reached 10 health health upgrades add time to your timer.
    
    WASD - Up, Down, Left, Right
    
    Enter - Select/Attack
    
**!! IMPORTANT !!**
    Check console for seed input when starting a new game
